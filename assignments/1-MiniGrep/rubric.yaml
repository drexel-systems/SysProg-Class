  requirements:
  - description: allocate line buffer using malloc
    criteria:
    - must use malloc to allocate the buffer
    - must check to make sure malloc succeeds
    - must allocate the buffer to be 256 bytes using the LINE_BUFFER_SZ macro
    - must free the buffer before program exits
  - description: implement and comment the str_len function
    criteria:
    - must calculate string length without using strlen()
    - must use pointer arithmetic only, no array notation
    - must return correct length (not including null terminator)
    - must be properly commented
  - description: implement and comment the str_match function
    criteria:
    - must search for pattern anywhere in the line (not just at start)
    - must support case-sensitive matching (case_insensitive = 0)
    - must support case-insensitive matching (case_insensitive = 1)
    - must use pointer arithmetic only, no array notation
    - must return 1 if found, 0 if not found
    - must be properly commented
  - description: implement file reading and basic search
    criteria:
    - must open file using fopen() and check for errors
    - must read file line by line using fgets()
    - must search each line using str_match()
    - must print matching lines
    - must close file when done
    - must handle file errors appropriately
  - description: implement the -n option (line numbers)
    criteria:
    - must print line numbers before matching lines
    - format should be "linenumber: content"
    - line numbers should start at 1
  - description: implement the -i option (case-insensitive)
    criteria:
    - must pass case_insensitive flag to str_match()
    - must match patterns regardless of case
  - description: implement the -c option (count)
    criteria:
    - must count matching lines
    - must print "Matches found: X" where X is the count
    - must print "No matches found" if count is 0
    - must not print the actual matching lines (only the count)
  - description: proper error handling and return codes
    criteria:
    - exit with 0 on success (pattern found)
    - exit with 1 when pattern not found
    - exit with 2 on command line errors
    - exit with 3 on file errors
    - exit with 4 on memory allocation failure
  - description: EXTRA CREDIT implement support for multiple files
    criteria:
    - must accept multiple filenames on command line
    - must search all files provided
    - must print filename before each matching line
    - format should be "filename:linenumber: content" (if -n is used)
    - format should be "filename: content" (if -n is not used)
  - description: EXTRA CREDIT implement the -v option (invert match)
    criteria:
    - must print lines that do NOT contain the pattern
    - must work with other flags (-n, -c, -i)
    - if combined with -c, should count non-matching lines
