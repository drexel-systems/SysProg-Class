# Questions

Answer the following questions about your minigrep implementation:

## 1. Pointer Arithmetic in Pattern Matching

In your `str_match()` function, you need to check if the pattern appears anywhere in the line, not just at the beginning. Explain your approach for checking all possible positions in the line. How do you use pointer arithmetic to advance through the line?

## 2. Case-Insensitive Comparison

When implementing case-insensitive matching (the `-i` flag), you need to compare characters without worrying about case. Explain how you handle the case where the pattern is "error" but the line contains "ERROR" or "Error". What functions did you use and why?

## 3. Memory Management

Your program allocates a line buffer using `malloc()`. Explain what would happen if you forgot to call `free()` before your program exits. Would this cause a problem for:
   - A program that runs once and exits?
   - A program that runs in a loop processing thousands of files?

## 4. Buffer Size Choice

The starter code defines `LINE_BUFFER_SZ` as 256 bytes. What happens if a line in the input file is longer than 256 characters? How does `fgets()` handle this situation? (You may need to look up the documentation for `fgets()` to answer this.)

## 5. Return Codes

The program uses different exit codes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) for different situations. Why is it useful for command-line utilities to return different codes instead of always returning 0 or 1? Give a practical example of how you might use these return codes in a shell script.
